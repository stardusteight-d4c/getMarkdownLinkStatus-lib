# getMarkdownLinkStatus-lib
<li> To create a project in NodeJs we use the command npm init;
<li> The package.json file is used by NodeJS to list installed dependencies, as well as information 
about program version, authorship and scripts;
<li> Dependencies (also called libs or libraries) are packages of ready-made code that other people in the community make available,
and we use them to perform specific tasks in the code without having to rewrite it from scratch;
<li> We can use JavaScript's native fs (File System) lib so that the program can access and read files from the computer;
<li> We were able to catch error messages sent by NodeJS when something in the program doesn't come out as expected using the throw keyword;
<li> That “promises” are the way JavaScript uses to work with asynchronous code and that we can solve them using the async 
and await keywords together or the .then() method;
<li> How to use regular expressions, a syntax designed to recognize text patterns, to capture links and URLs;
<li> We use regular expression classes and groups to refine the search for these patterns, in addition to the methods that JavaScript has 
(eg match and exec) to bring the results and work with them;
<li> Manipulating the results extracted from the text through regular expressions and assembling a return object using JavaScript syntax;
<li> Using the command line interface and how we apply the JavaScript lib process to capture and use the data reported in the terminal in our code;
<li> To organize the code separating in files the functions that deal with input and output of data from the functions that process the links;
<li> How to make these different files talk to each other by exporting and importing modules with module.exports and require();
<li> What scripts are instructions we use to automate tasks and how to write our own scripts, include them in the package.json configuration 
file and use them to execute commands in the terminal;
<li> How to use node-fetch lib to access URLs and return information as HTTP status code;
<li> Using the Promise.all method to asynchronously access an array of URLs and receive the result;
<li> Combining the use of node-fetch and promises with async/await to ensure the code runs asynchronously, returning the results;
<li> That unit tests are used to test small pieces of code separately and that we use the Jest lib methods to execute them;
<li> How to read test results and what each part of Jest's syntax means, such as the describe(), it() and toEqual() methods;
<li> As we think about tests in order to guarantee that an error in the use of the program actually generates a response and
that it is important that this occurs to ensure that possible errors do not go unnoticed by the user.
